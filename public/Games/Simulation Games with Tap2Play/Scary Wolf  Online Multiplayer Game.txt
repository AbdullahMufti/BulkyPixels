Grrrr. Raise and grow your wolf clan and fight for survival in this brand new scary wolf multiplayer game! Have you ever imagined being a ferocious wolf in the wild?

Experience being the Alpha Wolf, leader of the pack, in a realistic jungle environment! Your task is to survive in the wilderness as long as possible. Start your own clan and fight for your place in the wild against fierce predators! Your deadliest weapons are your sharp claws, acute sense of smell, and a powerful jaw and trusty wolf pack. Maintain your stamina and health; monitor your hunger and thirst; and perform activities in the average life of a wolf. Your clan can help you in combat and in hunting and gathering. Raise your family and build them up to be fierce warriors! Go hunting with your mates and gather food. Train and grow your cubs so they can learn to be independent, strong, and ferocious wolves! Teach them teamwork, as a wolf pack cannot survive without having one another's backs!

Start your journey of adventure, either solo or with friends. Immerse yourself in a beautiful safari and wildlife environment, with animals such as deer, elephant, and lions roaming around. This game's new modes feature: offline mode, where you survive on your own; and online mode where you can join your friends or play against them. Team up against your enemies with your pack and show them who’s boss!

Will you be a friend or foe?
