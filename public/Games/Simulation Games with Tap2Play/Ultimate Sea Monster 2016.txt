CHOMP CHOMP CHOMP. Is it a shark? Is it a whale? It’s a sea monster!

Play as a menacing prehistoric sea monster in a marine hunting adventure. Experience a realistic underwater sea environment! This precarious beast smells sea animals and humans! Feed its insatiable appetite by attacking boats, ships, and ski jets! Scour out reefs and miles of ocean for your target. Locate the unexpecting human enjoying the beach and rip them apart! Use your massive jaws to create havoc before they escape. Use your sharp submarine eyes to spot prey. Complete your hunt before you get hunted! Take control of this terrifying mammal (or fish, we’re not too sure either!) and enjoy your meal.
