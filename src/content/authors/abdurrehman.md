I'm delighted to introduce myself as Abdur Rehman Mufti, a passionate 11 Years experianced Unity Developer with a strong commitment to working for a social cause and making a significant difference in the lives of underprivileged children in India and other developing countries.

In my extensive career spanning over a decade of experience, I've had the privilege of collaborating on a diverse range of projects. I've successfully published at least 75+ games on the Google Play Store, Apple App Store, and other distribution channels. These games stand as a testament to my proficiency in Unity, my ability to take projects from scoping requirements through prototyping to their actual launch, and my dedication to delivering high-quality experiences.

My expertise extends to professional software engineering practices and best practices for the full software development life cycle, including coding standards, code reviews, source control management, build processes, and rigorous testing. I pride myself on writing well-structured, readable, and well-documented code, ensuring the longevity and maintainability of each project.

With a scrappy, entrepreneurial attitude and a relentless drive to accomplish high-quality projects swiftly, I consistently exceed expectations. English proficiency, both spoken and written, is another asset I bring to the table.

Additionally, I possess the following preferred qualifications:

Proficiency in Agile methodologies.
In-depth knowledge of Computer Science fundamentals, including data structures, algorithm design, databases, and efficient data storage.

I'm excited about the opportunity to combine my technical expertise with my passion for social impact and gaming to create meaningful projects. I look forward to the possibility of collaborating with your team to make a positive difference in the world.

Regards,
Abdur Rehman Mufti
